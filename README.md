websites to house my own store selling trading cards.

The UX for this webapp uses Bootstrap, custom CSS and crispy_forms for overall styling and Structure

### Database Structure
The product and category fixtures were custom made for this project to reflect the stock of products that
I currently have in stock.

## Features

### Current Features
Current features of the app allow customers to purchase trading cards to delivery anywhere in the UK.

#### Products
As a user you have the ability to browse products by category, sort products by a variety of filters, search
for a specific product in the search bar and add them to a shopping basket.

#### Checkout
As a user you have the ability to add and remove products from your shopping bag and continue through to
as secure checkout powered by Stripe payment system. The user has the option to check out as a guest or
save their detail into a profile for future purcases.

#### User Profiles
Users have the option to save their details during a transaction to use in the future. Profile page also
shows a breakdown of previous purchases in an order history display. 

### Future Features
This webstore could benefit from an admin account. However i chose not to include this in this project 
as I will be the one managing the site. Given that I will be uploading products whole sets at a a time I 
will be implementing more fixtures and a diffrent database layout to accomodate for more variety of product 
categories.
